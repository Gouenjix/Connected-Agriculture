## Introduction

There is a rapid development in technology which is influencing human life in several aspects due to rapid development in different fields, but we still need to adopt that technology such that we can make human life easier to live. In our country, while farming, the farmers don't know if the field has sufficient water or if the soil quality is good/bad, etc. until and unless they go and manually check the field for the status of the field and crop, making it more time-consuming. Sometimes they miss turning on the pumps, adding fertilizer, or releasing excess water from the field on time, which leads to less productivity.

## Objective

The project uses a range of sensors, including humidity and water sensors, and a fire sensor to detect any potential fires in the field. Additionally, our project incorporates a relay module to operate a motor, which will automatically start pumping water into the field when the water level goes low. With this technology, farmers can easily monitor soil moisture levels and water levels while also ensuring their fields are safe from potential fires. Our project is an innovative solution that helps to improve agricultural efficiency, reduce water waste, and increase crop yields, while also providing a more sustainable and safer farming environment, making farming and agriculture processes easier and more efficient.
